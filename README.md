# Northwind C# Project

A project to help me learn and gain experience with various C#/.NET technologies.

I will:

- Download Microsoft's Northwind database in MS SQL
  - <https://github.com/Microsoft/sql-server-samples/tree/master/samples/databases/northwind-pubs>
  - If MS SQL doesn't work, here's the PostgreSQL link: <https://github.com/pthom/northwind_psql>
- Create a C# API to retrieve data from the database
  - Using LINQ to query
  - Using Lambdas (what for, though?)
- Create a Blazor/MAUI application/website to display that data
- Create unit tests using xUnit for the API (and possibly any methods in my MAUI app)
